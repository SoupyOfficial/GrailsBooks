To get RabbitMQ up and running on your system there are multiple different ways to get setup and going. You may choose
to follow the directions from RabbitMQ themselves located https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html[here], but we would
recommend following the way we set it up for parity.

To have a similar to real world setup we have chosen to setup our RabbitMQ using https://www.docker.com/[Docker] as its
quick, simple, and easy to tear down and setup again if you run into any issues. Docker is a container engine which allows
for quick and simple installs of many different frameworks and products and helps avoid differences in local systems to
provide a guaranteed clean instance of the product you are tying to run. We will assume you already have Docker
installed on your system moving forward but if you do not you can install it from https://www.docker.com/community-edition[here].

Make sure Docker is running on your local system (You should see a little whale)

Once you know Docker is up and running from your terminal run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 4369:4369 -p 5671:5671 -p 5672:5672 -p 15671:15671 -p 25672:25672 rabbitmq:3-management
----

The above command does a lot for you, it downloads and runs a dockerized instance of RabbitMQ, sets the hostname, gives
the instance a name, configures the ports you will need to successfully access RabbitMQ, and includes the management
interface so we can have more insight to how the message queue works. Once the command completes you will see output
similar to the following.

In addition to Docker you may like a more visual interface to see your RabbitMQ container in action. If thats the case go
ahead and download "Kitematic" which is a GUI interface for your underlying Docker service. Docker will even help you get
Kitematic from its menu.

If you installed Kitematic you should now see your RabbitMQ instance running on the lefthand side.

As mentioned above we included the RabbitMQ admin interface so we can see some details about our message queues. You can
access the admin interface located at `localhost:15672`.

To login use the username / pass of guest / guest. After a successful login you will see the following page
