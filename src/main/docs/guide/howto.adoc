To get started do the following:

* link:https://github.com/{githubSlug}/archive/master.zip[Download] and unzip the source

or

* Clone the https://git-scm.com/[Git] repository: +
`git clone https://github.com/{githubSlug}.git`

The Grails guides repositories contain three folders:

* `initial`  Initial project. Often a simple Grails app with some additional code to give you a head-start.
* `complete`
* `complete-analytics`

In this guide you are going to create two Grails Applications. Both `complete` and `complete-analytics` apps are a completed example. It is the result of working through the steps presented by the guide and applying those changes to the `initial` folder.

To complete the guide, go to the `initial` folder

* `cd` into `{githubSlug}/initial`

and follow the instructions in the next sections.

TIP: You can go right to the **completed example** if you `cd` into `{githubSlug}/complete` and `{githubSlug}/complete-analytics`.
