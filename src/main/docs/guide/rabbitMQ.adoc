The construct of message queues provides for asynchronous communications, meaning that the sender and receiver
do not need to interact with the message queue concurrently. When a message is sent it will be added to the queue and stored
until the recipient retrieves them. Message queues can be used inter-app or with multiple applications. A number of different
implementations of message queues exist but one of the more popular and the one we will use for this guide is RabbitMQ.
