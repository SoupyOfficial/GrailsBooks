The construct of message queues provides for asynchronous communications, meaning that the sender and receiver
do not need to interact with the message queue concurrently. When a message is sent it will be added to the queue and stored
until the recipient retrieves them. Message queues can be used internally in an app or externally with multiple applications.
A number of different implementations of message queues exist but one of the more popular and the one we will use for
this guide is RabbitMQ.
