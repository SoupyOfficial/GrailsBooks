As mentioned earlier in section 3.1 <<setupRabbit>> we have access to the rabbit management console located at `http://localhost:15672`.
Go ahead and navigate to the console and login. Once logged in select `Queues` from the menu.

from here you can see the two queues which we have created with our applications. Now select the `Overview tab and
return to the management home page. When looking at the home page note that there are 0 messages in the queue.

At this point stop your analytics app from the terminal with `Ctrl-C` and then go back to your still running app and go click
on and view a few more books. Once you have viewed a few more books, return to your admin home and you will see that new
messages have been generated and are waiting in the queue.

Go ahead and restart your analytics app now from your terminal

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

Once your analytics app has restarted you will see it process the waiting messages and when you return to the rabbit admin
you will see the message queue has returned to 0.
